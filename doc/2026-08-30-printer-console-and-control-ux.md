# Printer console and G-code control experience

**Date:** 2026-08-30

**Status:** Final user experience

**Scope:** The printer-console and printer-control experience shared by the
Electron desktop application and the Web application.

## Purpose

The application provides two connected but independent ways to use a user's
printer:

1. View and manage the printer's Web console inside the application.
2. Send G-code to the printer and optionally start a print through its HTTP
   API.

The embedded console is a convenience and management surface. Sending and
printing use the printer API directly, so either surface can continue to be
used when the other one is unavailable.

## Device page

Device is a top-level page alongside Workspace. Workspace contains only the
profile/settings sidebar and the 3D scene. Switching between pages preserves
the state of both surfaces.

The Device page uses the same card-style visual language as Workspace:

- The left card contains the saved printer list and an add-printer action.
- The right card contains the selected printer's embedded console.
- The sidebar can be resized, starts at 288 px, and stays between 220 px and
  560 px. Its width is remembered independently from the Workspace sidebar.

Each printer row shows its name and has separate Edit and Delete actions.
Deleting a printer requires confirmation. Adding or editing a printer opens a
configuration dialog.

## Printer configuration

The configuration dialog accepts:

- A display name.
- The built-in **Moonraker** adapter.
- A required **API base URL**.
- An optional **Console URL**.
- An optional, password-masked **API key**.

If Console URL is left blank, the embedded console uses the API base URL. A
separately entered Console URL is used as-is after normal URL validation.

Printer configurations are saved across sessions in the application's user
configuration. The same complete printer record is retained by Electron and
Web, including the API key when one is supplied. The API key is optional: a
printer without one can still be used for Moonraker operations that do not
require authentication.

## Console selection and behavior

The Device console selection is always explicit and is not saved. Adding a
printer does not select it automatically. If the selected printer is deleted,
the selection becomes empty and the console shows an empty state rather than
silently selecting another printer.

Selecting a printer opens its configured console in the right-hand card. The
console is a focused printer-management surface, not a general browser: the
application does not provide an address bar, history controls, or an editable
navigation target.

On Electron, a supplied Moonraker API key can be reused by the embedded console
so the user does not need to enter it again each time. On Web, the console is
shown in a normal iframe and keeps its own browser-managed login/session
behavior; the application does not inject the API key into the iframe.

Web embedding is best effort. Browser and printer policies, local-network
access, HTTPS/mixed-content rules, CORS, or a console's own framing policy may
prevent the console from displaying. The application reports the console
problem when it occurs and does not treat it as proof that direct printer
control is unavailable.

## Send G-code

After a successful slice, the toolbar provides two separate actions:

- **Send** uploads the G-code and leaves it on the printer.
- **Send & Print** uploads the G-code and starts printing after the upload
  succeeds.

The send dialog has its own printer selector, independent of the Device
console selection. It never remembers the selected target. A deleted or
otherwise unavailable target leaves the selector empty; the user must choose
a printer explicitly.

The API base URL and Moonraker adapter are required for sending. An API key is
not required; when it is empty, the application sends the request without an
API-key header. The Web application attempts the direct API request subject
to browser networking rules, while Electron can use its desktop networking
path. Compatibility is determined when the requested operation runs rather
than by a separate setup check.

The dialog shows upload progress and allows cancellation while an upload is
in progress. If Send & Print uploads successfully but starting the print
fails, the dialog explains that the file is already on the printer and offers
a start-only retry. Retrying does not upload the file again.

On success, the dialog counts down from five seconds before closing. The
**Close and switch to Device after sending** option is persisted and enabled
by default. When enabled, the success message counts down to closing and
switching to Device; when disabled, it only counts down to closing. The
printer selector and this option are disabled while sending and during the
success countdown. Close remains available for early dismissal. Errors,
cancellation, and a failed print start never navigate to Device.

## Platform differences

Electron provides the richer embedded-console experience, including automatic
Moonraker API-key reuse when a key is configured. Web provides the standard
iframe console experience and does not inject scripts into the embedded page.
Both platforms retain the same printer configuration, independent selections,
Moonraker Send/Send & Print behavior, and best-effort handling of actual
network or printer failures.
