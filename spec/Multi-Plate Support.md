# Multi-Plate Support

**Status:** Draft — interaction model accepted; implementation and persistence details remain under review

**Date:** 2026-09-05

**Scope:** The shared Electron and Web application's Prepare workspace, up to
36 plates.

## Accepted interaction model

- Prepare renders all plates simultaneously in an OrcaSlicer-style, automatically
  reflowed grid. The first release supports at most **36** plates, matching
  OrcaSlicer's product/UI limit.
- One plate is the current plate. Selecting a plate through plate UI changes
  the current plate and supplies the context for plate-scoped operations.
- Clicking a model on a non-current plate does **not** automatically select
  that plate.
- Object selection and editing remain global across the visible grid. Users may
  select objects or instances from different plates together and move, scale,
  rotate, or delete them in one operation.
- Plate membership is not an editing restriction. After each committed geometry
  or transform edit, the application recomputes each affected instance's plate
  membership from its resulting placement. An instance outside every printable
  plate is reported as unprintable rather than silently assigned to a plate.
- Slice, G-code export, and send-to-printer operate on the current plate only
  in the first implementation. Batch "Slice all" and multi-plate export/send
  behaviour are deferred decisions.

## Architectural direction

The implementation will mirror OrcaSlicer's state model without importing its
wxWidgets/OpenGL GUI classes: a headless, WASM-owned plate session maintains
per-plate membership, metadata, settings, and slice-result state, while the
shared React layer renders the grid and controls. The existing platform
contracts remain host-neutral.

Further decisions are intentionally pending: membership calculation rules at
plate boundaries, project-load/save fidelity, per-plate settings, plate
creation/deletion/reordering, per-plate preview retention, and the detailed
bridge/client contract.
